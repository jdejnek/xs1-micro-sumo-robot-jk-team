## XS1 Micro Sumo Robot

Meet the XS1 Micro Sumo — a tiny gladiator built from sensors, motors, and a stubborn will to push other robots out of the ring.

## Where to start

For ease of use, consider installing the Arduino IDE

`brew install --cask arduino-ide`

### The obvious next steps
- Get familiar with the code files: `XS1-Micro-Sumo-Robot-Code.ino`.
- Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE, select the correct board/port, and upload.
- Use the Arduino Serial Plotter to get familiar with the sensor inputs and their thresholds

And the get creative!
